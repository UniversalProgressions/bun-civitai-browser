# Project Brief: CivitAI Model Browser

## Foundation

A fullstack application built on Bun.js with Elysia backend, React frontend, Prisma ORM with SQLite, and integrated Gopeed download service.

## Overview

Building a desktop web application for browsing, downloading, and managing AI models from CivitAI with local storage organization and download task management.

## Core Requirements and Goals

- **Local Model Management**: Scan, index, and organize downloaded models with metadata, search, and filtering capabilities
- **Download Integration**: Submit CivitAI model URLs/IDs to Gopeed via API for robust downloading
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor download progress, manage tasks (pause/resume/cancel), and maintain download history
- **Settings Management**: Configure storage paths, API tokens, and Gopeed server settings
- **User Interface**: React-based gallery for local models, download panel, and settings configuration
